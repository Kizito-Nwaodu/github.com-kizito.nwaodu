ðŸ’¡ **Projects & Hands-on Experience**:  

ðŸ”¹ Administered Directory Domain services, managing users, groups, Group Policy Objects, and ensuring secure
authentication and authorization.

ðŸ”¹ Configured and deployed and Microsoft Entra Internate Acces using Microsoft Intune on test BYOD.

ðŸ”¹ Installed and managed Internet Information Services on Azure VM, demonstrating proficiency in cloud computing, web
hosting and application deployment.

ðŸ”¹ Implemented resource locks on simulated critical Azure resource groups, protecting virtual machines storage accounts
from accidental deletions and unauthorized modifications. This project reinforced my knowledge of Azure resource
management and data protections strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Developed and implemented Azure Policies to restrict virtual machine deployment to approved SKUs(D2s_v4),
simulating real-world cost optimization and standardization. This project showcased my ability to use Azure Policies to
enforce compliance and manage cloud resources effectively.

ðŸ”¹ Implemented Privileged Identity Management roles to secure administrative access to stimulated critical resources,
enforcing least privilege access control. This project reinforced my understanding of IAM principles and best practices.

ðŸ”¹ Configured encrypted simulated storage and optimized lifecycle policies, ensuring encryption for data-at-rest and
reducing storage expenses.

ðŸ”¹ Deployed Azure monitor and set up custom alerts for proactive issue detection, enabling rapid response to potential
security threats and infrastructure issues in a simulated production environment. 

ðŸ”¹ Implemented an account lockout policy on Entra ID, simulating various attack scenarios. This project demonstrated my understanding of Entra ID security features and access control, effectively mitigating
simulated brute force attacks.

ðŸ”¹ Designed, deployed and managed simulated phishing and other social engineering attacks using Microsoft Attack Simulation. This project assessed user vulnerability and identified areas of weakness
leading to targeted security awareness training recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ Designed and Implemented Data Loss Prevention and Endpoint DLP policies, protecting simulated sensitive data (PII, financial data) from unauthorized access or exfiltration. This project demonstrated
my ability to configure and deploy DLP policies effectively.

ðŸ”¹ Configured Defender for Endpoint to monitor and respond to simulated threats, improving endpoint security posture and enabling proactive threat detection and response. This included configuring realtime protection and attack surface reduction rules.

ðŸ”¹ Completed the Phishing Email challenge on LetsDefend.io: Analyzed phishing emails to identify malicious content, links and attachments, demonstrating practical skills in phishing detection and email
security.

ðŸ”¹ Completed the Email Analysis challenge on LetsDefend.io: Analyzed email headers to trace the origin ofemails, identify spoofing attempts, and detect potential security threats showcasing expertise in email forensics and threat analysis.
